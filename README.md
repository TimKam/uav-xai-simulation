# Explainable UAV Simulation
This repository contains the source code of an *explainable* UAV (drone) simulation.
The purpose of the simulation is to test different explanation and information filtering modes in
human-computer interaction studies.

The simulation makes use of [JS-son](https://github.com/TimKam/JS-son), a JavaScript library for
implementing reasoning-loop agents.

## Installation and Deployment
To run the simulation locally, proceed as follows:

1. Clone the repository with ``git clone git@github.com:TimKam/uav-xai-simulation.git``.

2. Navigate into the project's root directory.

3. Start the simulation and the hot-reload loop with ``npm start``.
